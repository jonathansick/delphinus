    General parameters are initialzed upon instantiation, while parameters

    Parameters
    ----------
    PSFPhot : int
        Type of photometry to be run. Options are

        - 0 (aperture),
        - 1 (standard PSF-fit)
        - 2 (PSF-fit weighted for central pixels).
        
        Option 1 is suggested for most photometric needs, but option 0 can
        provide superior photometry if the signal-to- noise is high and the
        field is uncrowded.
    FitSky : int
        Sky-fitting setting. Options are
        
        - 0 (use the sky map from calcsky)
        - 1 (fit the sky normally prior to each photometry measurement)
        - 2 (fit the sky inside the PSF region but outside the photometry
          aperture),
        - 3 (fit the sky within the photometry aperture as a
          2-parameter PSF fit), and
        - 4 (fit the sky within the photometry
          aperture as a 4-parameter PSF fit).
        
        Options 1 and 3 are the suggested settings. Option 0 should be used
        only if the field is very uncrowded; option 2 can be used in extremely
        crowded fields; option 4 can help in fields with strong background
        gradients (though I have yet to see this be useful).
    RCentroid : int
        The centroid used for obtaining initial positions of stars is a
        square of size 2RCentroid + 1 on each side.
    SigFind : real
        Sigma detection threshold. Stars above this limit will be kept in the
        photometry until the final output.
    SigFindMult : real
        Multiple for sigma detection threshold in initial finding algorithm.
        This should be close to one for larger PSFs, and as low as 0.75 for
        badly undersampled PSFs.
    SigFinal : real
        Sigma threshold for a star to be listed in the final photometry list.
        To get all stars, set SigFinal equal to SigFind.
    MaxIT : int
        Maximum number of photometry iterations.
    FSPS : str
        The functional form of the analytic PSF. Allowable options are “Gauss”
        (Gaussian), “Lorentz” (Lorentzian), “Lorentz2” (a squared Lorentzian),
        and “G+L” (sum of Gaussian and Lorentzian).
    SkipSky : int
        Sampling of sky annulus; set to a number higher than 1 to gain speed at
        the expense of precision. This is only used if FitSky is set to 1.
        In general, this should never be larger than the FWHM of the PSF.
    SkySig : real
        Sigma rejection threshold for sky fit; only used if FitSky is set to 1.

    NoiseMult : real
        To allow for imperfect PSFs, the noise is increased by this value
        times the star brightness in the pixel when computing chi values.
    FSat : real
        Fraction of nominal saturation for which pixesl are considered
        saturated.
    Zero : real
        Zero point for a star of brightness 1 DN per second.
    PosStep : real
        Typical stepsize in x and y during photometry iterations. Should be set
        to a factor of a few smaller than the PSF FHWM.
    dPosMax : real
        Maximum position change of a star during a single photometry iteration.
        Note that this parameter is currently ignored.
    RCombine : real
        Minimum separation of two stars (they will be combined if they become
        closer than this value). This value can generally be about 2/3 of the
        PSF FWHM, but no less than 1.42.
    sigPSF : real
        Minimum signal-to-noise for a PSF solution to be attempted on a star.
        Fainter detections are assigned type 2.
    PSFStep : real
        Typical stepsize of FWHM during photometry iterations. Setting to zero
        will replace PSF solution with three-state solution in which a star
        will be very small, fit the stellar PSF, or very large.
    MinS : real
        Minimum FWHM for a good star (type 1). This should be set to something
        like half the PSF FWHM.
    MaxS : real
        Maximum FWHM for a good star (type 1). This needs to be set to
        something larger than the FWHM of the PSF.
    MaxE : real
        Maximum ellipticity for a good star (type 1).
    UseWCS : int
        Use WCS header information for alignment? Allowed values are 0 (no),
        1 (use to estimate shift, scale, and rotation), or 2 (use to estimate
        a full distortion solution). Note that any shifts or rotations selected
        by img shift and img xform are applied in addition to what is
        determined by the WCS solution. If reducing HST data, selecting
        UseWCS=1 can eliminate the need for running the fitdistort utilities.
        UseWCS=2 generally is not recommended for HST data since the
        distortion coefficients provided with DOLPHOT provide higher-order
        corrections than do the WCS headers.
    Align : int
        Align images to reference? Allowed values are 0 (no),
        1 (x/y offsets only), 2 (x/y offsets plus scale difference),
        and 3 (x/y offsets plus distortion).
    Rotate : int
        Correct for rotation in alignment? Allowed values are 0 (no) and
        1 (yes).
    SecondPass : int
        Number of additional passes when finding stars to locate stars in the
        wings of brighter stars. Must be a non-negative value.
    SearchMode : int
        Sets the minimization used to determine star positions. Allowed values
        are 0 (chi divided by SNR) and 1 (chi only). A value of one appear
        safe for all applications. A value of zero has been seen to fail if
        images of very different exposure times are used together.
    Force1 : int
        Force all objects to be of class 1 or 2? Allowed values are 0 (no) and
        1 (yes). For crowded stellar fields, this should be set to 1 and the
        chiand sharpness values used to discard extended objects.
    EPSF : int
        Allow elliptical PSFs in parameter fits? Allowed values are 0 (no) and
        1 (yes).
    PSFsol : int
        Make analytic PSF solution? Allowed values are -1 (no),
        0 (constant PSF), 1 (linear PSF variation), and
        2 (quadratic PSF variation).
    PSFres : int
        Solve for PSF residual image? Allowed values are 0 (no) and 1 (yes).
        Turning this feature off can create nonlinearities in the photometry
        unless PSFphot is also set to zero.
    psfstars : str or None
        Specify coordinates of PSF stars. The file must contain extension,
        chip, X, and Y (the first four columns of DOLPHOT output).
    psfoff : real
        Coordinate offset of PSF star list. Values equal the list coordinates
        minus the DOLPHOT coordinates, and would thus be 0.5 if using a DAOPHOT
        or IRAF star list.
    ApCor : int
        Make aperture corrections? Allowed values are 0 (no) and 1 (yes).
        Default aperture corrections always have the potential for error, so
        it is strongly recommended that you manually examine the raw output
        from this process.
    SubPixel : int
        The number of PSF calculations made per dimension per pixel. For
        Nyquist-sampled images, this can be set to 1, but very small PSFs
        require the extra precision.
    FakeStars : str or None
        Run DOLPHOT in artificial star mode. The FakeStars parameter is the
        name of the text file containing the artificial star data. The file
        should contain the following information for each star, one star per
        line: extension (0 = main image), chip (usually 1), X, Y, and the
        number of counts on each image. If the warmstart option is being used,
        one also needs to specify the recovered X, Y, and object type values
        before the counts. Note that photometry must be run first; the
        photometry list, PSFs, etc. from DOLPHOT are used as inputs in the
        fake star routine.
    FakeMatch : real
        Maximum allowable distance between input and recovered artificial star.
    FakePSF : real
        Approximate FWHM of the image, used to determine which of two input
        stars a recovered star should be matched with.
    FakeStarPSF : int
        Use PSF residual from initial photometry run. This should be left at
        zero, unless the PSF residuals are small and well-measured.
    RandomFake : int
        Apply Poisson noise to fake stars when adding them. This should always
        be used, unless running fake star tests twice (once with and once
        without) to quantify photometric errors from crowding and background
        independently of the errors due to photon noise.
    xytfile : str or None
        star list filename for warmstart
    xytpsf : str or None
        PSF solution for the reference image for difference image photomtry.
    photsec : list or None
        Optinally, specify a subset fo the image to be photometered (relative
        to first image, or referene image). Pass a list of six integer values:
        extension (usually 0), Z (usually 1), minimum X, minimum Y, maximum X,
        maximum Y.

        Parameters
        ----------
        path : str
            file path of FITS file (without the .fits suffix)
        psfA : tuple
            PSF XX term, length 6. Set the PSF x-FWHM and linear and quadratic
            variations. This value can be an initial guess that is later
            adjusted by DOLPHOT.
        psfB : tuple
            PSF YY term, length 6. Set the PSF y-FWHM and linear and quadratic
            variations. This value can be an initial guess that is later
            adjusted by DOLPHOT.
        psfC : tuple
            PSF XY term, length 6. Set the PSF eccentricity and linear and
            quadratic variations. This value can be an initial guess that is
            later adjusted by DOLPHOT.
        shift : tuple
            x,y shifts relative to reference. Set offset of image relative to
            reference. This value can be an initial guess that is later
            adjusted by DOLPHOT. Values are x and y on the image minus x and y
            on the reference image. Note that this parameter should not be set
            for the reference image.
        xform : tuple
            Set the scale ratio, cubic distortion, and rotation of the image
            relative to the reference image. This value can be an initial
            guess that is later ad- justed by DOLPHOT. Note that this
            parameter should not be set for the reference image.
        aprad : real
            Radius for aperture correction
        apsky : tuple
            Set the inner and outer radii of the annulus used for calculating
            sky values for aperture corrections.
        raper : real
            Sets the size of the aperture within which photometry will be
            performed. For FitSky=0 or 1, this should include most of the
            light of the star. For FitSky=2, 3, or 4 options, this should also
            include significant “sky” area outside the star.
        rsky : tuple
            Inner, outer radius for computing sky values, if FitSky=1 is being
            used. This should be outside the bulk of the light from the star.
            Outer radius should be sufficiently large to compute an accurate
            sky.
        rpsf : int
            Size of the PSF used for star subtraction. The rule of thumb is to
            make sure this is sufficiently large that significant unsubtracted
            star light is not seen beyond the subtracted regions in the
            residual image.
        rchi : real
            Sets the size of the aperture within which the chi value will be
            calculated. This is used to determine object locations. This
            should generally include only the peak of the stellar PSF. RChi
            cannot be larger than RAper. If not defined, RChi is set equal to
            RAper.
        ref : bool
            set as True if this is the reference image, False otherwise
